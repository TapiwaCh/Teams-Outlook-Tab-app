# OutlookCmdApp - Microsoft Teams App

Generate a Microsoft Teams application.

TODO: Add your documentation here

## Getting started with Microsoft Teams Apps development

Head on over to [Microsoft Teams official documentation](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-teams) to learn how to build Microsoft Teams Tabs or the [Microsoft Teams Yeoman generator docs](https://github.com/PnP/generator-teams/docs) for details on how this solution is set up.

## Project setup

All required source code are located in the `./src` folder:

* `client` client side code
* `server` server side code
* `public` static files for the web site
* `manifest` for the Microsoft Teams app manifest

For further details see the [Yo Teams documentation](https://github.com/PnP/generator-teams/docs)

## Building the app

The application is built using the `build` Gulp task.

``` bash
npm i -g gulp-cli
gulp build
```

## Building the manifest

To create the Microsoft Teams Apps manifest, run the `manifest` Gulp task. This will generate and validate the package and finally create the package (a zip file) in the `package` folder. The manifest will be validated against the schema and dynamically populated with values from the `.env` file.

``` bash
gulp manifest
```

## Deploying the manifest

Using the `yoteams-deploy` plugin, automatically added to the project, deployment of the manifest to the Teams App store can be done manually using `gulp tenant:deploy` or by passing the `--publish` flag to any of the `serve` tasks.

## Configuration

Configuration is stored in the `.env` file.

## Debug and test locally

To debug and test the solution locally you use the `serve` Gulp task. This will first build the app and then start a local web server on port 3007, where you can test your Tabs, Bots or other extensions. Also this command will rebuild the App if you change any file in the `/src` directory.

``` bash
gulp serve
```

To debug the code you can append the argument `debug` to the `serve` command as follows. This allows you to step through your code using your preferred code editor.

``` bash
gulp serve --debug
```

* [Developing with Github Codespaces](https://github.com/pnp/generator-teams/blob/master/docs/docs/user-guide/codespaces.md)

## Additional build options

You can use the following flags for the `serve`, `ngrok-serve` and build commands:

* `--no-linting` or `-l` - skips the linting of Typescript during build to improve build times
* `--debug` - builds in debug mode and significantly improves build time with support for hot reloading of client side components
* `--env <filename>.env` - use an alternate set of environment files
* `--publish` - automatically publish the application to the Teams App store

## Deployment

The solution can be deployed to Azure using any deployment method.

* For Azure Devops see [How to deploy a Yo Teams generated project to Azure through Azure DevOps](https://www.wictorwilen.se/blog/deploying-yo-teams-and-node-apps/)
* For Docker containers, see the included `Dockerfile`

## Logging

To enable logging for the solution you need to add `msteams` to the `DEBUG` environment variable. See the [debug package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/debug) for more information. By default this setting is turned on in the `.env` file.

Example for Windows command line:

``` bash
SET DEBUG=msteams
```

### Establish a secure tunnel to your tab

At the command prompt exit the localhost and enter the following command to establish a secure tunnel to your tab:

```cmd
gulp ngrok-serve
```

> [!IMPORTANT]
> After your tab is uploaded to Microsoft Teams through **ngrok**, and successfully saved, you can view it in Teams until your tunnel session ends.

### Upload your application to Teams

1. Go to Teams and select **Apps**&nbsp;:::image type="content" source="~/assets/images/tab-images/store.png" alt-text="Teams Store":::.
1. Select **Manage your apps** > **Upload an app** > **Upload a custom app**.
1. Go to your project directory, browse to the **./package** folder, select the zip folder, and choose **Open**.


1. Select **Add** in the dialog. Your tab is uploaded to Teams.

1. In the left pane of Teams, select ellipses &#x25CF;&#x25CF;&#x25CF; and then choose your uploaded app to view your personal tab.

   Now you've successfully created and added your personal tab in Teams.
  
   As you have your personal tab in Teams, you can also [reorder](#reorder-static-personal-tabs) your personal tab.
